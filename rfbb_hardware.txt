RF Transmitter module pinout
----------------------------

A common RF transmitter module like TX433N (433.92MHz) has the following pinout:

Pin    Function
1      GND
2      Data in
3      VCC
4      Antenna

Make sure that VCC is able to operate from 5V DC and the Data In threshold 
is compatible with 3.3V logic.
The range is often 3 - 12 V DC, but there might be other versions!     


Raspberry Pi example
--------------------

RPI               TX433N
Pin, function  -  Pin, function
P1-02, 5V0     -  3, VCC
P1-06, GND     -  1, GND
P1-11, GPIO17  -  2, Data in
No connection  -  4, Antenna. Connect a 170mm wire as antenna
